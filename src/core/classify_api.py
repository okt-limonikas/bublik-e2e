"""Create the plan's classification issues and rules against imported runs.

This runs after the API import wave and before the held-back ``+ui`` bundles are
imported by the Playwright suite. That ordering is the whole point: a rule
created here did not exist when the ``+ui`` run was generated, so when Bublik
stamps that run on import it is demonstrably the *rule* doing the work and not
the fixture.

Rules are created through ``POST /results/classify/`` — the bulk endpoint the UI
itself calls — rather than by POSTing to ``/issue_rules/`` directly. That way the
fixture exercises the real triage path. The endpoint takes the matcher in full,
one per test among the results, so what a rule should contain is read first from
``POST /results/classify/options/``: the test id, the parameters and verdicts the
result has, and the run's important tags. This module never reconstructs any of
those itself.

Each rule classifies its pin's single result, and Bublik otherwise applies rules
only on import, so the API-seeded runs -- imported before any rule existed --
would carry one stamp per rule and nothing else. The last stage therefore
re-applies the rules to every API-seeded run that carries pins, through
``POST /runs/{id}/apply_rules/`` (the UI's "Apply rules" button). That is what
gives an issue a realistic number of results across runs and days; the ``+ui``
run remains the proof that import-time stamping works on its own.
